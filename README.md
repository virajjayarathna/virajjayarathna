# Hi, I'm Viraj 👋

## I'm a DevOps Engineer building robust platforms and bridging the gap between infrastructure and full-stack development.

<br />

I'm a tech professional passionate about creating scalable, reliable, and observable systems. My core expertise lies in **cloud infrastructure** (especially AWS), **platform engineering**, and implementing comprehensive **monitoring** solutions.

I'm not just focused on infrastructure; I'm actively expanding my skills in **backend development** to understand the full application lifecycle. My goal is to build seamless, end-to-end solutions where the application and the platform work in perfect harmony.
